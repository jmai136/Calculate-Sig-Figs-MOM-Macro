# MOM-Calculate-sig-figs
3 methods that handles calculating significant figures for addition/subtraction and multiplication/division. Originally intended for creating a macro on MyOpenMath.

## WhAT DOES THE CODE DO
For both calculating addition/subtraction and multiplication/division functions, there are unknown amount of parameters, presumably that would be the numbers you are calculating with, from there the code returns the least precise decimal place/sig fig in order to determine the sum/difference/product/quotient's sig figs.
